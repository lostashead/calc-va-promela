# model checking with variability

## FEATURES
・These codes are for graduate thesis. <br>
・Calculate the model that should be model checking with priority considering the probability from the model with variability.<br>

## MODELS
・Created assuming a state machine diagram.<br>
・You have to change model directly in files.json when you want to do model checking for other model.

## NOTES
・Does not support communication between multiple state machines.<br>
・The probability of the model should be given as the initial probability. After determining the probability using Bayesian network etc., edit it directly in files.json.<br>
・This code is very close to incomplete and is missing yesterday. You need to work harder to make it better.
